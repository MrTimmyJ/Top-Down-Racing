## Overview

This is a top-down 2D racing game built with Python and Pygame.
Players control a custom car sprite and race against an AI.
The AI's path is loaded dynamically through a text file (AI.txt), allowing for map modding and custom challenges.
The objective is to pass through all rings (checkpoints) and beat the AI to the finish.

🧩 Features

    🚗 Custom top-down sprites for player and AI

    🧠 AI pathing from external AI.txt file (easy to mod!)

    🌄 Changeable background images for track customization

    ⭕ Power-up / checkpoint ring system to guide gameplay

    🕹️ Keyboard-driven player controls with directional sprite changes

    ⏱️ Finish-time tracking and high score system (written to a file)

🎮 Gameplay

You control a car from a top-down view using arrow keys or WASD. Pass through each power-up ring to progress. Once all rings are passed, the timer stops and your time is saved.

### Controls:

| Key   | Action     |
| ----- | ---------- |
| ↑ / W | Move Up    |
| ↓ / S | Move Down  |
| ← / A | Turn Left  |
| → / D | Turn Right |

⚙️ How It Works <br>
Player Initialization

    Loads directional car sprites and places the player on the track

    Handles input to update position and sprite direction

AI Movement

    AI.txt contains a list of X,Y coordinates

    AI moves through these points in order, simulating a racing path

Power-Ups / Rings

    Represent checkpoints around the track

    The player must pass through all to finish the race

    Once completed, the timer ends, and the high score is recorded

Timer and Scoring

    The timer starts on game load

    Stops once all rings are passed

    High score saved to highscore_list.txt in hh:mm:ss.ss format
